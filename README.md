# SPL-to-KQL Cheatsheet: Why this?
The idea is to simply save some quick notes that will make it easier for Splunk users to leverage KQL (Kusto), especially giving projects requiring both technologies (Splunk and Azure/Sentinel) or any other hybrid environments. The way the data (stream) is _manipulated_ is of course different but still quite easy for long-time Splunkers, the idea here is to get a head start before diving into formal KQL documentation.

Feel free to add/suggest entries or to fork the content into another repo/project.

If you are looking for _code translators_ or something similar, consider this project (never used though): https://uncoder.io

## How to get started?
For me the easiest was to get access to [Azure's Data Explorer](https://dataexplorer.azure.com) and start playing from there as it provides multiple datasets for interactiing and even allowing charts/dataviz rendering.

You can also start from [MS Tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/write-queries) on how to write KQL queries.

### KQL Doc Reference
It's always good to have that handy allowing deeper investigation of all the features (each table entry provides a more specifc reference link).

[Kusto Query Language (KQL) reference doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/)

Also consider this nice cheatsheet doc from Markus Bakker: https://github.com/marcusbakker/KQL/blob/master/kql_cheat_sheet_v01.pdf
